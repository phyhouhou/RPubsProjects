## Projects in My RPubs

Johns Hopkins Unversity offered a Data Science Specialization program on Coursera. It is a 10-course specialization including:<br>

* The Data Scientistâ€™s Toolbox
* R Programming
* Getting and cleaning data
* Exploratory data analysis
* Reproducible research
* Statistical Inference
* Regression models
* Practical machine learning 
* Developing data products
* Data Science Capstone

I've completed all the courses and obtained the Certificate on 4/2017. Some of the projects are published in Rpubs. Here is the [link](https://rpubs.com/phyhouhou). I also build a predictive text model as a shiny app to predict the next word users will enter following its previous inputs. Feel interested? Click [here](https://phyhouhou.shinyapps.io/NextWordPredictor/) to give it a try.
